              <h1> DEFORESTATION AND EFFECTS OF DEFORESTATION </h1>
            
            
            <h2> WHAT IS DEFORESTATION??</h2>
            <h3>DEFORESTATION means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes</h3>
            <h3> Trees in the forest are cut for some of the purposes mentioned below - </h3>
            <div class = "ways">
            <li>Procuring land for cultivation.</li>
            <li>Building houses and factories.</li>
            <li>Making furniture or using wood as fuel.</li>
        </div>
            <h2>EFFECTS OF DEFORESTATION</h2>
            <div class = effects>
            <p> After knowing what deforestation is let's now know
             in what ways does it effect our enviroment.
            </p>
            <li>Increase in temprature </li>
            <li>Increases pollution level on earth</li>
            <li>Increases the level of carbon dioxide</li>
            <li>Ground water level also gets lowered</li>
            <li>Disturbs balance in nature</li>
            <li>Changes the soil properties </li>
            <li>Fewer trees result in more soil erosion </li>
            <li>Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts by the process called DESERTIFICATION. </li>
            <li>Changes the nutrient content , texture etc.. of soil </li>
            <li>Decreases the water holding capacity of the soil</li>
        </div>
            <h2> MORE ABOUT IT</h2>
            <h3>if cutting of trees continues , rainfall and the fertility of the soil will decrease moreover there will be increased chances of natural calamities such as FLOODS and DROUGHTS. Plants need carbon dioxide for photosythesis . Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in atmosphere .This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by earth , disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall , this could cause DROUGHTS . Deforestation also leads to decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil .The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground is reduced so , there are floods   </h3>

            <h2> Some facts </h2>
            <div class = "facts">
             <li>31% of the earth's surface is covered by forests</li>
             <li>2,400 trees are cut down eacg minute</li>
             <li>14,800 square miles of forest are lost every year </li>
             <li>In 2019 approximately 9 million acres of rainforests were destroyed </li>
             <li>137 different species of plants , animals and birds are lost every single day due to global forest loss</li>
            <li>50,000 species are lost each year as result of deforestation </li>
            <li>25% of all cancer fighting drugs come from rainforests</li>

            <H1>CONCLUSION </H1>
            <h3> SO, after all the things we have looked at regarding deforestation , it's now clear that it causes nothing but harm to animal and plant kingdom . We humans have more developed mind then any other animal . Over the years we have discovered so many things , gained so much knowledge then why are we still not understanding that cutting trees is ultimately threatening our future and our chances to survive in future . It really is high time we should pay attenion to deforestation , find a solution for it and plan a healthy future for us . Cutting trees for our own use is not only threatening but selfish of us to destroy home of different species around the world .  </h3>
             <h3>here are some things we should start implementing for our better future </h3>
             <div class = "things">
             <li>Plant trees</li>
             <li>Use less paper</li>
             <li>Recycle paper</li>
             <li>Use recycled products</li>
             <li>Tell people around you not to cut trees (spread awareness</li>
